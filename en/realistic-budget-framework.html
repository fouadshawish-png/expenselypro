      <h2>Why Most Budgets Fail</h2>
      <p>
        Traditional budgets often collapse because they are based on hope, not data. People underestimate expenses, overestimate discipline, and ignore the need for flexibility. A realistic budget is grounded in your actual spending patterns and adapts as your life changes.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Overly optimistic projections</li>
        <li>Failure to account for irregular expenses</li>
        <li>Lack of regular review and adjustment</li>
        <li>Rigid categories that don’t reflect reality</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>The 5-Step Realistic Budget Framework</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Assess:</strong> Gather real data on income and expenses</li>
        <li><strong>Allocate:</strong> Distribute funds across fixed, variable, and strategic categories</li>
        <li><strong>Cap:</strong> Set weekly and monthly limits for each category</li>
        <li><strong>Review:</strong> Analyze performance weekly and monthly</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust:</strong> Refine your budget as life evolves</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        This framework is designed for flexibility and sustainability. It works with any income level and adapts to changing circumstances.

    <section class="section" id="assess">
      <h2>Step 1: Assess Your Financial Reality</h2>
      <p>
        Start by collecting data from the past 2–3 months. Include all sources of income and every expense, no matter how small. Use bank statements, receipts, and expense tracking apps for accuracy.
      </p>
      <h3>What to Include</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Salaries and wages</li>
        <li>Freelance or side income</li>
        <li>Recurring bills (rent, utilities, subscriptions)</li>
        <li>Variable expenses (groceries, dining, transport)</li>
        <li>Irregular costs (gifts, repairs, travel)</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="allocate">
      <h2>Step 2: Allocate by Category</h2>
      <p>
        Divide your expenses into three main groups: fixed, variable, and strategic. Fixed expenses are predictable and recurring. Variable expenses fluctuate. Strategic categories are aligned with your goals (savings, investments, debt repayment).
      </p>
      <h3>Sample Categories</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed: Rent, insurance, subscriptions</li>
        <li>Variable: Food, utilities, entertainment</li>
        <li>Strategic: Savings, investments, debt payments</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Allocate a realistic amount to each category based on your assessment. Don’t forget to leave room for unexpected costs.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="cap">
      <h2>Step 3: Set Weekly and Monthly Caps</h2>
      <p>
        Instead of only setting monthly limits, break your budget into weekly caps. This makes it easier to spot problems early and adjust before overspending becomes a crisis.
      </p>
      <h3>How to Set Caps</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Divide monthly totals by four for weekly guidance</li>
        <li>Use apps or spreadsheets to track progress</li>
        <li>Review spending at the end of each week</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="review">
      <h2>Step 4: Review Regularly</h2>
      <p>
        A budget is a living document. Review your performance every week and month. Compare actual spending to your caps, and look for patterns or problem areas.
      </p>
      <h3>Review Checklist</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Did you stay within your caps?</li>
        <li>Were there any unexpected expenses?</li>
        <li>Which categories need adjustment?</li>
        <li>Are you making progress toward your goals?</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="adjust">
      <h2>Step 5: Adjust and Optimize</h2>
      <p>
        Life changes—so should your budget. Adjust categories, caps, and allocations as needed. The goal is not perfection, but progress and sustainability.
      </p>
      <h3>Common Adjustments</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Increase savings as income grows</li>
        <li>Reduce spending in non-essential categories</li>
        <li>Reallocate funds after major life events</li>
      </ul>
