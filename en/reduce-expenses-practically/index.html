<h1>How to Reduce Expenses Practically (Without Extreme Cuts)</h1>

<p>Expense reduction should not feel like punishment. Sustainable financial control requires strategic adjustments, not emotional deprivation.</p>

<h2>The 3-Layer Reduction Model</h2>

<h3>1. Fixed Expenses</h3>
<p>Review subscriptions, renegotiate bills, optimize recurring payments.</p>

<h3>2. Variable Expenses</h3>
<p>Set weekly limits for groceries, dining, and transport.</p>

<h3>3. Behavioral Spending</h3>
<p>Identify impulse triggers and create weekly awareness checkpoints.</p>

<h2>Why Extreme Budget Cuts Fail</h2>
<p>Over-restriction increases rebound spending. Balanced reduction maintains stability.</p>

<h2>The Weekly Adjustment Strategy</h2>
<p>Instead of cutting aggressively at the start of the month, adjust weekly based on real spending patterns.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Practical expense reduction is about optimization, not sacrifice. Use short review cycles to stay in control without stress.</p>
