<h1>About the System Creator</h1>

<p>Most financial tools focus on tracking. The structured weekly money system was created to solve the deeper problem: the lack of review cycles.</p>

<h2>The Observation</h2>
<p>People do not fail because they lack effort. They fail because they operate without checkpoints.</p>

<h2>The Philosophy</h2>
<p>Log daily. Review weekly. Adjust before problems compound.</p>

<h2>The Difference</h2>
<p>This is not a budget tracker. It is a weekly financial operating system.</p>
