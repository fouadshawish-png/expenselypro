      <h1>Expense Control System: Mastering Your Daily Spending</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to the definitive guide to building an Expense Control System. This is not just about tracking receipts—it's about creating a repeatable, intelligent process for managing your daily spending, detecting financial leaks, and building a foundation for long-term financial stability. This guide is designed for a global audience seeking a professional, system-based approach to personal finance.

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Why Expense Control Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Most financial problems start with uncontrolled spending. Without a clear system, small leaks become major drains. Expense control is the backbone of any successful financial plan, enabling you to make informed decisions, avoid unnecessary debt, and achieve your goals.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Gain clarity on where your money goes</li>
        <li>Spot and eliminate wasteful habits</li>
        <li>Build discipline and financial confidence</li>
        <li>Lay the groundwork for effective budgeting and saving</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="system-overview">
      <h2>System Overview: The 4-Step Expense Control Framework</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Capture:</strong> Record every transaction, no exceptions</li>
        <li><strong>Categorize:</strong> Assign each expense to a meaningful category</li>
        <li><strong>Review:</strong> Analyze spending patterns weekly</li>
        <li><strong>Correct:</strong> Take action to fix leaks and optimize habits</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        This framework is designed for consistency and clarity. It works whether you use an app, spreadsheet, or pen and paper.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="capture">
      <h2>Step 1: Capture Every Transaction</h2>
      <p>
        The first rule of expense control: never trust your memory. Record every purchase, bill, and payment as soon as it happens. This habit is the foundation of financial awareness.
      </p>
      <h3>Best Practices for Capturing Expenses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use a dedicated app or notebook</li>
        <li>Log expenses immediately—don’t wait until the end of the day</li>
        <li>Include cash, card, and digital payments</li>
        <li>Record the amount, date, and a brief note</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Consistency is more important than perfection. Missed a day? Start again the next day.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 2: Categorize Intelligently</h2>
      <p>
        Categories turn raw data into actionable insights. Avoid overcomplicating—choose categories that reflect your real spending patterns and goals.
      </p>
      <h3>Recommended Categories</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Essentials (housing, food, utilities)</li>
        <li>Transportation</li>
        <li>Health & Wellness</li>
        <li>Personal & Lifestyle</li>
        <li>Entertainment</li>
        <li>Debt Payments</li>
        <li>Savings & Investments</li>
        <li>Other (miscellaneous)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Tips for Effective Categorization</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Review and refine categories monthly</li>
        <li>Merge or split categories as your life changes</li>
        <li>Be honest—don’t hide problem areas</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="section" id="review">
      <h2>Step 3: Weekly Review for Early Detection</h2>
      <p>
        A weekly review is the secret weapon of expense control. It allows you to catch issues before they become crises and make small, manageable adjustments.
      </p>
      <h3>How to Run a Weekly Review</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Summarize total spending by category</li>
        <li>Compare to your planned limits or previous weeks</li>
        <li>Identify overspending or unusual patterns</li>
        <li>Set one actionable goal for the next week</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Benefits of Weekly Reviews</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Immediate feedback and course correction</li>
        <li>Less stress at month-end</li>
        <li>Continuous improvement of habits</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="correct">
      <h2>Step 4: Correct and Optimize</h2>
      <p>
        Expense control is not about restriction—it’s about optimization. Use your weekly insights to make targeted changes.
      </p>
      <h3>Common Corrections</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Set spending caps for problem categories</li>
        <li>Unsubscribe from unused services</li>
        <li>Plan meals to reduce food waste</li>
        <li>Negotiate bills or switch providers</li>
        <li>Automate savings for surplus funds</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Small corrections, made consistently, lead to major results over time.
