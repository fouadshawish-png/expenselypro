<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Last updated: 2026-02-26</p>

<h2>1. Overview</h2>
<p>
Expensely Pro ("we", "our", or "the App") is a personal financial management application.
We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency regarding how data is handled.
</p>

<h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

<h3>Account Information</h3>
<p>
If you sign in using Google Sign-In, we may access your name, email address,
and basic profile information strictly for authentication purposes.
</p>

<h3>Financial Data</h3>
<p>
All financial entries (expenses, income, debts, notes) are stored locally on your device.
If cloud synchronization or backup is enabled, data may be stored securely using Firebase services.
</p>

<h3>Analytics Data</h3>
<p>
We use Firebase Analytics to collect anonymous usage statistics.
This helps us understand feature usage and improve performance.
No personally identifiable financial details are shared for analytics purposes.
</p>

<h2>3. Data Storage & Security</h2>
<p>
Data stored in Firebase services is protected by industry-standard security practices,
including encrypted transmission (HTTPS).
Access to cloud data is restricted to authenticated users.
</p>

<h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
<p>
We do not sell, trade, or rent personal financial information.
Third-party services such as Google Firebase and Analytics process limited data
solely to provide authentication, hosting, and analytics functionality.
</p>

<h2>5. User Control</h2>
<p>
You may delete your account and associated cloud data at any time within the app.
Uninstalling the app removes locally stored data from your device.
</p>

Expensely Pro is not directed to children under 13.
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
