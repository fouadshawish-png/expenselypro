      <h2>Why Weekly Reviews Matter</h2>
      <p>
        Most financial plans fail because they are reviewed too late. A weekly review provides early feedback, prevents small problems from becoming big ones, and keeps you engaged with your goals.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Spot overspending before it snowballs</li>
        <li>Stay accountable to your budget and goals</li>
        <li>Reduce stress and financial surprises</li>
        <li>Build a sustainable financial rhythm</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="section" id="collect">
      <h2>Step 1: Collect Your Data</h2>
      <p>
        Start by gathering all transactions—expenses and income—from the past week. Use your app, bank statements, or manual logs. The goal is a complete, honest picture.
      </p>
      <h3>Tips for Effective Collection</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Don’t skip cash transactions</li>
        <li>Include one-off or irregular expenses</li>
        <li>Be consistent—same day and time each week</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="compare">
      <h2>Step 2: Compare to Your Plan</h2>
      <p>
        Compare your actual spending and income to your budget or targets. Look for categories where you stayed on track and those where you didn’t.
      </p>
      <h3>What to Look For</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Categories over or under budget</li>
        <li>Unexpected expenses</li>
        <li>Progress toward savings or debt goals</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="analyze">
      <h2>Step 3: Analyze Trends and Patterns</h2>
      <p>
        Go beyond the numbers. Ask why you spent more or less in certain areas. Look for patterns—good or bad—that repeat week to week.
      </p>
      <h3>Questions to Ask</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>What triggered overspending?</li>
        <li>Are there recurring leaks?</li>
        <li>What habits led to positive results?</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="correct">
      <h2>Step 4: Correct Course</h2>
      <p>
        Choose one actionable change for the next week. Don’t try to fix everything at once—focus on the highest-impact adjustment.
      </p>
      <h3>Examples of Corrections</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Set a lower cap for a problem category</li>
        <li>Plan meals to reduce food spending</li>
        <li>Automate a savings transfer</li>
        <li>Schedule a midweek check-in</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="celebrate">
      <h2>Step 5: Celebrate Wins</h2>
      <p>
        Recognize progress, no matter how small. Celebrating wins builds motivation and makes the review process enjoyable.
      </p>
      <h3>Ways to Celebrate</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Share your progress with a friend or partner</li>
        <li>Reward yourself with a small treat</li>
        <li>Reflect on your achievements in a journal</li>
      </ul>
